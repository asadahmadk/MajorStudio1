For my qualitative data project I have decided to visualization the impact of 17 SDGs by 2030. This project will be completed after 2nd iteration. Below are the description for each iteration and explains the process.

**Design Prototype**
After 3 iterations, the idesign was finalized to make it useable and understandable. The designs can be seen on figma. https://www.figma.com/file/z4EFQqbQp440rW9ZLRDuZn/Qualitative-Data-v3?node-id=0%3A1&t=43CYrt8GQC1NamMY-0


**Coding Prototype**

Donut Graphs are constructed depicting the impact from low to high. So far I have been able to code the donut graphs and added some description in the html file.
